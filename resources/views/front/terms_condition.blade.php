<h5>TERMS AND CONDITIONS
</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Terms for Accommodations products and services.
  </li>
</ol>
<h6>Contractual understanding</h6>
<ol>
  <li>R&S not a ‘contractual party’ to your booking when made to any Service Provider</li>
  <li>R&S owns and operates the Platform.</li>
  <li>R&S only shows staycation and tours that have a commercial relationship with us, and it doesn’t necessarily show all their products or services.</li>
  <li>Information about Service Providers (e.g. facilities, house rules and sustainability measures) and their Travel Experiences (e.g. prices, availability and cancellation policies) is based on what they provide to us. They’re responsible for making sure it’s accurate and up to date.</li>

</ol>

<h6>What we will do
</h6>
<ol>
  <li>R&S provides a Platform on which Service Providers can promote and sell their Rooms and Accommodations – and a customer can freely search, compare and book them.</li>
  <li>Once a booking is made, we will provide you and the Service Provider with details of your Booking with names.
  </li>
  <li>Based on the terms of your Booking, we may be able to help you change or cancel upon your wish or situation.
  </li>
</ol>

<h6>What you need to do
</h6>
<ol>
  <li>Provide your contact details correctly, so we and/or the Service Provider can process the booking and confirm it. If necessary we can contact you.
  </li>
  <li>Read these Terms and the terms displayed during the booking process carefully.
  </li>
  <li>Take care of the Accommodation and its furniture, fixtures, electronics and other contents, and leave things in the same state they were when you got there. If anything is broken, damaged or lost, make sure you report it to the staff there (as soon as you can, and certainly before you check out).
  </li>
  <li>Maintain the security of the Accommodation and its contents during your stay. So don’t, for example, leave doors or windows unlocked.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Price and payment</h5>
<h6>We Price Match</h6>
<ol>
  <li>R&S wants the best possible result for your price every time. Once you book your Accommodation with us and you find the same Accommodation (with the same conditions) for less on another website, we shall refund the difference, subject to conditions.</li>
  
</ol>
<h6>Partner offer</h6>
<ol>
  <li>Some offers on our Platform are marked as 'Partner offers', which means they come to us through a R&S partner company, rather than straight from a Service Provider or us. Unless otherwise indicated, any Partner offer that you reserve:</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Must be paid for at the time of booking</li>
  <li>Can't be modified. However, if it offers free cancellation, you will be able to cancel it for free, as long as you do it in time.
  </li>
  <li>Can't be combined with any other offers (promotions, incentives or rewards)
  </li>
  <li>Can't be scored or reviewed on our Platform.
    Price incentives</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>Some of the price reductions you see are funded by us, not by the Service Provider. We simply pay some of the cost ourselves.</li>
  
</ol>

<h6>Damage Policy</h6>
<ol>
  <li>
    When you’re booking, you may see that some Service Providers refer to a ‘damage policy’. This means that if anyone in your group loses or damages anything:
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>you should inform the Service Provider</li>
    <li>instead of charging you for it directly, the Service Provider will have 14 days to submit a damage payment request through our Platform, under your reservation number</li>
    <li>if they do, we’ll tell you, so you can tell us if you have any comments, and whether or not you agree with the charge - and then:
    </li>
    <ul class="innerterms">
      <li>if you agree, we’ll charge you on their behalf</li>
      <li>if you disagree, we’ll look into it and decide whether or not to discuss it further*.</li>

    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Any payment you make would be between the Service Provider and you – we’d just be organising it on the Service Provider’s behalf.
  </li>
  <li>The damage policy doesn’t relate to general cleaning, ordinary wear and tear, any crimes (such as theft), or any non-physical ‘damages’ (e.g. fines for smoking or bringing pets).</li>
</ol>

<h5>How We Work
</h5>
<h6>Scope of this section</h6>
<ol class="termsnumber">
  <li>This section contains the specific terms for Attractions products and services.</li>
</ol>
<h6>Contractual relationship
</h6>
<ol>
  <li>We do not (re)sell, offer or provide any Attractions on our own behalf - when you book an Attraction, you enter into a contract directly with (a) the Service Provider or (b) a Third-Party Aggregator (if they’re reselling the Attraction), as disclosed during the booking process.
  </li>
  <li>We act solely as the Platform and are not involved in the Third-Party Terms. We are not responsible for your ticket and (to the fullest extent permitted by law) have no liability to you in relation to your Booking.
  </li>
</ol>
<h6>What we will do</h6>
<ol>
 <li> We provide the Platform on which Service Providers and (from time to time) Third-Party Aggregators can promote and sell Travel Experiences – and you can search for, compare and book them.</li>
 <li>Once you’ve booked your Attraction, we’ll provide you and the Service Provider with details of the Booking; if the Service Provider needs more than your name, we’ll tell you at the time of booking.
</li>
<li>Depending on the terms of your Booking, we may be able to help you change or cancel it if you wish to.</li>
</ol>
<h6>What you need to do
</h6>
<ol>
  <li>You must fill in all your contact details correctly, so we and/or the Service Provider can provide you with information about your Booking and, if necessary, contact you.</li>
  <li>You must read and agree to comply with our Terms and the Third-Party Terms (which will be displayed at checkout) – and acknowledge that breaching them may lead to additional charges and/or the cancellation of your Booking.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Cancellations</h5>
<h6>If you cancel:
</h6>
<ul>
  <li>MORE THAN 48 hours before your rental is due to start, you’ll receive a full refund.
  </li>
  <li>LESS THAN 48 hours before, or while you’re at the rental counter, we’ll refund what you paid minus the cost of 3 days of your rental - so there won’t be any refund if your car was booked for 3 days or less.
  </li>
  <li>AFTER your rental is due to start (or you just don’t turn up) you’ll receive no refund.
  </li>
</ul>
